# 🤖 My take on a bot template!
This is a full Discord bot template that uses discord.js v14 and supports slash commands. I created this template so beginners can use it and build on top of it.

# 💻 Setting the bot up

First off, click the "Use this template" button to create a repository with the template.

After that you are good to clone your newly created repository!
```sh
git clone
```
Next up you will have to install all the dependencies by running 
```sh
npm install
```
Then, you are going to create a file with the name config.json. Copy and paste the example bellow.
```json
{
  "token": "BotToken",
  "devs": ["DevId1", "DevId2"],
  "clientId": "BotClientID"
}
```
- token - your bot's token, acquired in the developer portal
- devs - the ID's of the bot developer(s)
- clientID - The bot's client ID, can be acquired from the developer portal

You are all set to run the bot now. Have fun!
```sh
npm run start
```

> ⚠️ Bear in mind that you must be using Node.js v16.9.0 or higher!
